This repository contains a collection of scripts that are intended to help you in your pen-testing and bug-hunting efforts. These scripts automate various manual tasks, making your work more efficient and effective. Descriptions of the scripts are given below:

To set up a pen-testing environment, we need to install lots of tools including various Go tools. Installing them one by one can be very time-consuming. So here we have a script that installs `over 40` important Go tools at once.

Subdomain brute forcing is a useful technique for discovering hidden subdomains of the targets, which increases the chances of finding vulnerable systems. We have a script that creates a wordlist of `over 66 million` subdomains for this purpose.

Identifying live hosts and open ports, and determining the version of services running on them from a list of targets can be a time-consuming and repetitive task. To automate this process, we have a script that takes a list of hosts as input and performs all of these tasks at once.
